# Code challenge notebook: Loops and functions
© ExploreAI Academy

In this coding challenge, we will apply our Python programming skills to automate more complex movement of our farm equipment. We will use functions to make our code more modular, making it simpler to read, modify, and extend.

⚠️ **NOTE: This notebook should be used to work though the code challenge, but should not be submitted. Please transfer your code to `GCC_Submit_loops_and_functions.ipynb` and submit that file online. Submitting this notebook will **fail** the autograder tests.**

### Instructions

- **Do not add or remove cells in this notebook. Do not edit or remove the `### START FUNCTION` or `### END FUNCTION` comments. Do not add any code outside of the functions you are required to edit. Doing any of this will lead to a mark of 0%!**

- Answer the questions according to the specifications provided.

- Use the given cell in each question to see if your function matches the expected outputs.

- Do not hard-code answers to the questions.

- The use of StackOverflow, Google, and other online tools is permitted. However, copying a fellow student's code is not permissible and is considered a breach of the Honour code. Doing this will result in a mark of 0%.
